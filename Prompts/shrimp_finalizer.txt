 # **Prompt: Selecting the Most Complete Structured Data from Parsed URL Outputs**

## **Objective:**  
Your task is to analyze multiple structured outputs extracted from different URLs and select the **best populated version** for each field while maintaining consistency and accuracy.

---

## **Task Details:**  
You are given a list of structured data dictionaries, each representing a parsed shrimp product entry from different sources. Your goal is to **combine the most populated and accurate data** into a **single structured output**, ensuring that:

1. **Fields are maximally populated** by taking values from the best available source.
2. **Fields remain consistent** (e.g., if `breed` is "Angus" in multiple sources, retain it; if different values exist, prioritize the most frequently occurring one).
3. **The most trustworthy URLs** (those with `is_match = True`) are prioritized when selecting values.
4. **Boolean fields** are assigned `true` if **any** valid source marks them as `true`, otherwise, they remain `false` or `null` if absent.
5. **The final output remains structured in valid JSON format** matching the schema.

---

## **Selection Criteria:**
- **Primary Source Preference:** Entries where `is_match = True` should be prioritized.
- **Field Completion Preference:** If a field is `null`, look for the most populated source to fill it.
- **Boolean Fields Handling:** If any source has `true` for a boolean field, set it to `true`; otherwise, `false` or `null` if unavailable.
- **URL Selection:** Prefer the URL that provides the **most populated** and **most accurate data**.

---

## **Output Format (Final Structured JSON)**
You must return a **single structured JSON object**, combining the most complete data across sources:
