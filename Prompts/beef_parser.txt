Objective:
    - Extract structured beef product attributes from raw pre-stripped HTML content for the specific product given. The extracted data must conform to the BeefAttributes schema.

Task:
    - You are an expert in structured data extraction. 
    - Your goal is to determine whether the HTML content contains information specific to an exact user-given beef product,
    - Then only if so, accurately extract beef product attributes from the provided plain-text HTML content (with tags removed) and return a structured JSON output that aligns with the BeefAttributes schema.
    - If there's no match, return None for the extracted attributes.

Instructions:
    - Analyze the given text content and locate all relevant product details.
    - Extract and normalize each attribute:
    - If an attribute is missing, return null for that field.
    - Ensure all categorical fields match the predefined valid options (e.g., breed, temperature, quality, type_blend, etc.).
    - Convert boolean values appropriately (True or False).
    - If the text contains ambiguous information, make an informed decision but prioritize accuracy.
    - Return the extracted data as JSON, structured according to the BeefAttributes schema.
    - Schema Definition (JSON)

The output must follow this format:
